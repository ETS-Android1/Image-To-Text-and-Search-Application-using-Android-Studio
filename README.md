# Google-Lens-Lite (Mobile App to scan an image, detect the text within the image and google search the latter for relevant results)


IDE: Android Studio 4.1.3
Firebase Authentication 

Description:
The app can pull and process text from images — including both actual photos you've taken and screenshots you've captured.
That latter part opens up some pretty interesting possibilities. 
Say, for instance, you've just gotten an email with a tracking number in it, but the tracking number is some funky type of text that annoyingly can't be copied. 
Or maybe you're looking at a web page or presentation where the text for some reason isn't selectable.
Or maybe youtube links , google forms or any hyperlinks.

Well, grab a screenshot , then make your way over to the app.
Tap the square-shaped photo icon in the app's upper-right corner, select the screenshot you just captured, and then select the text you want.
From there, you can copy the text or send it to google search bar for relevant search results or redirection to appropriate pages or websites.

The user can grab text from a physical document — a paper, a book, a whiteboard, or anything else with words on it — and then copy that text onto your phone's clipboard. 
From there, you can easily paste the text into a Google Doc, a note, an email, a chat, or anywhere else imaginable.

It's a super-easy way to get information and google search the same on any text from any physical document or captured image without having to manually peck in the words on your own.

Points to remember:
Donot forget to download and attach the google-services.json file along with the project during firebase connectivity.
It'll be generated along with your package name while creating project in firebase before connecting it to the IDE.
